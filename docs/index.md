# HomelabRC (Concept)

**HomelabRC** is an idea for a self-hosted dashboard designed to help users manage and monitor their homelab services. Inspired by platforms like gethomepage.dev, the goal is to create a customizable interface where users can display, interact with, and control their self-hosted applications and resources.

## Project Vision

The aim of HomelabRC is to:

- Provide a central location to view, manage, and monitor homelab services.
- Offer customizable dashboards with widgets for system monitoring, weather, bookmarks, and other tools.
- Focus on ease of configuration, allowing users to set up their dashboards through simple configuration files (e.g., YAML or JSON).
- Be built on **Angular** for a modern, fast, and responsive user interface.
- Support deployment via **Docker** for ease of installation and scaling.

## Features (Planned)

- **Service Management**: Easily add and organize services within a dashboard.
- **Custom Widgets**: Widgets for monitoring CPU, RAM, disk usage, and more.
- **Theming**: Light and dark mode options with flexible styling.
- **Mobile-Friendly**: Responsive design to work across devices.
- **Dockerized Deployment**: Simple deployment via Docker or Docker Compose.

## Current Status

At this point, **HomelabRC** is in the ideation stage. No code has been committed yet, but the general direction includes:

- Setting up an Angular-based front-end.
- Investigating integrations with popular self-hosted tools like Sonarr, Radarr, and more.
- Exploring methods for easy configuration and deployment via Docker.
